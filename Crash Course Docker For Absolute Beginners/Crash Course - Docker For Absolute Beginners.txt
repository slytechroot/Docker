Crash Course: Docker For Absolute Beginners
https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/crash-course-docker-for-absolute-beginner

Kickstart your containerization journey with a practical Docker tutorial designed for absolute beginners. This hands-on crash course focuses on the essential Docker CLI commands you’ll use every day. No prior Docker or DevOps experience required—just basic command-line familiarity. Through clear explanations and guided exercises, you’ll quickly learn how to work confidently with containers and images using real-world workflows.

What you’ll learn:

    Core concepts: What containers are, how they differ from virtual machines, and why Docker matters in modern development and DevOps.

    docker run: Launch your first containers, understand image auto-pull behavior, and name containers for easier management.

    docker ps: List running and stopped containers (including docker ps -a) and read essential container status details.

    docker stop: Safely stop containers to avoid data corruption and ensure graceful shutdowns.

    docker rm and docker rmi: Clean up your environment by removing containers and images to reclaim space and stay organized.

    docker pull: Download official images from Docker Hub and work with image tags (e.g., latest vs specific versions).

    docker exec: Open an interactive shell in a running container for troubleshooting and basic administration.

    Practice: Reinforce each concept with beginner-focused exercises that mirror real workflows.

Who this course is for:

    Developers, QA engineers, data scientists, and IT/DevOps newcomers who want a fast, practical introduction to Docker.

    Anyone seeking a simple, step-by-step Docker tutorial without prior container experienc

By the end: You’ll confidently use the fundamental Docker commands—run, ps, stop, rm, rmi, pull, exec—to launch, inspect, manage, and troubleshoot containers on Windows, macOS, or Linux using Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.


Containers - are isolated environments, with their own processes or services, their own network interfaces, their own mounds, just like virtual machines.

Docker utilizes LXC containers.


#start a container
docker run ansible
docker run redis
docker run nodejs
docker run nginx

Labs:
1)
To get the info on Docker CLI, run the command docker --help. Observe the options listed.

2)
Which Docker command is used to create and start containers from a specified image? 
docker run <image_name>

3)
If an image is not available locally, Docker will pull it from Docker Hub.
Yes, if an image is not available locally, Docker will pull it from Docker Hub. So, the answer is True.

TRUE!

4)
Spin up a Docker container using the Ubuntu image.
Note: Use the docker run command for this task.
Is the container spun up using the Ubuntu image?

Please execute the following command to spin up a container from image:
docker run ubuntu

5)
You executed the following Docker command in the previous question:

docker run ubuntu

Arrange the following events in the correct order of execution based on the output:

A. Docker checks if the ubuntu:latest image is available locally.

B. Docker pulls the ubuntu:latest image from Docker Hub.

C. A container is created from the ubuntu image.

D. The container runs with the default command specified in the image.

E. Docker displays a message about the image being downloaded.

Solution:
The correct order of execution is A,B,C,D,E


6)
The container that was started in the previous task is currently in an exited state. This occurs because a process needs to be run within the container to keep it alive.

You can verify the status of the container using the following command:

~ ➜  docker ps -a     
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

Commands -- docker pull, exec <------------------------

#pull download an image
docker run nginx

#ONLY to pull the image 
docker pull nginx

A docker container is only meant to run a task, not a full OS.

Once the task is complete, the task exits!
A docker container only exists for as long as the process in it is alive!!!!

docker run ubuntu sleep 5


docker ps -a

#see a file in the container.
docker exec distracted_mcclintock cat /etc/hosts

- this will print the contents of the /etc/hosts file.

1)
You are required to pull a Docker image, which will be used to run a container later. Pull the image nginx:1.14-alpine.
Pull only the image; do not create a container.

Solution:
Run the command docker pull nginx:1.14-alpine

The command docker pull nginx:1.14-alpine is used to download a specific version of the Nginx web server from the Docker Hub. In this case, it pulls the version 1.14 of Nginx that is based on the lightweight Alpine Linux distribution.

DONE.

2)
Run a container in detached mode with the nginx:1.14-alpine image and name it webapp.

Note: Use --name flag to name the container.

Solution:
Run the command docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine. Then, check the status of the container created using the docker ps command.

The command docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine performs the following actions:

    docker run: This is the command used to create and start a new container.
    -d: This flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it operates in the background and does not block the terminal.
    --name webapp: This flag assigns the name "webapp" to the container for easier reference.
    nginx:1.14-alpine: This specifies the image to use for the container, in this case, the Nginx web server version 1.14 based on the Alpine Linux distribution.

After running the command, you can check the status of the container with the command docker ps, which lists all running containers, showing their status, names, and other details.


~ ✖ docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine
ae25914aff0410f5300655fcd22bfdfc2be445bac26e73d69d0aff176a50553c

~ ➜  docker ps                                    
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES

3)
A Docker container is running in the background, and you want to run a command or open a shell inside this running container without stopping or restarting it.
Which Docker command should you use?

Solution:
The docker exec command lets you interact with a container that is already running.

docker exec

4)
An Ubuntu-based container running on the terminal. Create a file learning.txt under the root folder with the text This is the file.

Solution:
In the terminal, identify the container ID with the Ubuntu base image.

docker ps --filter ancestor=ubuntu --format '{{.ID}}'
Create a file in the container using the below command.
docker exec <container id> sh -c 'echo "This is the file" >> /root/learning.txt'


~ ➜  docker ps --filter ancestor=ubuntu --format '{{.ID}}'
13dca83bb269

~ ➜  docker exec 13dca83bb269 sh -c 'echo "This is the file" >> /root/learning.txt'
