--- Container vs Image differences
Container - is a running environment for IMAGE. It has a file system, environment configs, application image.
Application image: postgres, redis, mongo.
Port binded: talk to application running inside of container.
Virtual file system.

Demo....
docker pull redis
docker images
- the tag is the version of the image.
- so far we've only worked with images, so redis is not running.

- let's get redis running, so let's create a container containing the redis image
docker run redis
docker ps
(notice the Container ID, Image, Command, Status, ports, etc).
